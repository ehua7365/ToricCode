Toric Code Error Correction Simulation

Simulation written in Python using numpy to simulate 
error correction on the Toric Code using a very simple 
error model with bit flip errors only.

The Toric Code is a vey simple example of a topological
quantum error correction code first developed by Kitaev
in [Fault-quantum computation by anyons](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant--ph/9707021).
